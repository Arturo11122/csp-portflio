<h1> This is my About Me Page!</h1>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">This is my about me page as the title says.</pre>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">This about me page is supposed to be about me I think
but I have no idea what to write about.</pre>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">I could write about how awesome I am and how 
I am extremely smart (well people tell me that) and that I can make people laugh 
(well sometimes and most of the time its because I am being dumb which is ironic 
because people call me smart).</pre>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">I have a purpose in life. That purpose 
is to become a great theoretical physicist just like Albert Einstein 
(my other role model). Althoughthis goal my be far off, I will still 
pursue this career with the passion he once carried for the field of 
physics in order to changethe world and to have a deeper understanding 
of our universe.</pre>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">Other unimportant information about me is that I go to Don Lugo HS
as a senior. My favorite color is sky blue, I like to sleep and play
video games as well as to read articles concerning the sciences. My favorite 
subject
