<h1> This is my About Me Page!</h1>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">This is my about me page as the title says.</pre>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">This about me page is supposed to be about me I think
but I have no idea what to write about.</pre>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">I could write about how awesome I am and how 
I am extremely smart (well people tell me that) ans that I can make people laugh 
(well sometimes and most of the time its because I am being dumb).</pre>
<a href="http://mrengstromadmirer.weebly.com/">Mr. Engstrom Fan Page</a>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">For those who do not truly know the real Mr. Engstrom read this blog
that is 100% accurate with its information.</pre>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">Other than the information about Mr. Engstrom, 
I have a purpose in life. That purpose is to become a great theoretical 
physicist just like Albert Einstein (my other role model). Although
this goal my be far off, I will still pursue this career with the 
passion he once carried for the field of physics in order to change
the world and to have a deeper understanding of our universe.</pre>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">Other unimportant information about me is that I go to Don Lugo HS
as a senior. My favorite color is sky blue, I like to sleep and play
video games as well as to read articles concerning the sciences.
