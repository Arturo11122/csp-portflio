<font size="5"> App Inventor Project: The Budgeting App</font>

<pre style="font-family:courier;">After the use of Scratch to build our basic understanding of coding, we began to 
learn to use App Inventor to expand our knowledgeon coding. We had minor assignments here and there but the final 
project assigned to us was to build an app that had a purpose. My partner, Robert Olivares, and I decided to program 
a budgeting app because of its usefulness and it also seemed easy to code (which we were kind of wrong about). The 
bottom displays how each of of the screens look. From left to right, the first screen is the home page, the second 
screen is the listing page, teh third screen is the calculator, and the final screen is the help page in case the 
user did not know how to use the listing app. The link to the code is as follows <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?locale=en#5106293872001024">Budget App</a>.</pre>

<pre style="font-family:courier;">The hard part about coding the app was the alphabetizer button because I had trouble 
writing the code organizing the items. The code on the bottom displays how the code segment works but some of the 
code is not originally mine. Some of teh code comes from a youtube video called "APP inventor #10 List Sorting” 
posted by “Seongsu Lee”. I learned how the Tiny DB works and how a list works together.</pre>
