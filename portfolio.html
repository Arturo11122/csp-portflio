<pre style="font-family:courier;">From the start of the year, our computer science class has been working on
several projects on Scratch. One of the projects that I am extremely proud
of is the one that I and my partner, Pedro, worked on. The name of our game 
is called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172874591/#player">Dat Boi Game<a/> but the game we created was a remix from a game 
called "Save the MiniFigs".

<pre style="font-family:courier;">This is how the start screen looks like when the green flag is pressed.
I know that is does not look impressive but it was one of the first projects 
that I had to work with someone and do on my own.

<pre style="font-family:courier;">The code on the top controls the sprite using the mouse. When the score reaches 
thirty, the sprite begins to rotate around the mouse pointer.</pre>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">The final project for Scratch was between a story or a game and my partner, David, 
and I decided to create a game and its name is <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/174538457/">Dank Meme Quest<a/>. It was a difficult 
game to create due to the complexity of changing the backgrounds and implementing the enemies.

<pre style="font-family:courier;">The game opening is located on top left. The game was difficult to create (as stated 
from the top) but it was a learning experience as I improved my skills in "writing"
broadcast code. I also improved my skills in adding abstraction code to make the 
unnecessary sprites go away. The code next to the opening of the game displays 
how much code it was needed in order to program one sprite. </pre>
