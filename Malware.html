<pre style="font-family:courier;">My partner and I did extensive research on this topic from its origin, to how it works, 
to historical instances in which there was a major attack using this malware, to even how it has evolved in today's society. 
I learned more about malware and its effects on the current world of today and that there are ways to prevent these attacks 
similarly to how a person fights against infection. Clean up after yourself, don't touch potential diseases, and to not trust 
scams.</pre>
