<font size="5"> Python Project #3: Image Modifying Code (Image Artist)</font>

<pre style="font-family:courier;">The Image Modifying code was one of the harder projects to code because the idea 
of manipulating images through python seemed foreign to me. Some of the code I used was from a website called "Mouse 
vs. Python" under the sub categories of added border and color change. This code was exttremely helpful and in order to 
change the code to make it more personal, I changed some variables, combined the two by removing and adding components 
such as the part about saving the input image. I combined the output in order for the border to be added right 
after the input changed color to black and white.</pre>

<pre style="font-family:courier;">The code on top was the product of the combined efforts of Jonathon Vy and mine. 
Although it seems simple, I spent countless hours on trying to change the way the input system worked and how to combine 
the codes together. I actually learned how the color changes from the old picture to the new one and I am still figuring 
out how the border is added to the picture (I believe the ImageOps simplifies the code when the border is added). I learned 
that it is difficult to modify a picture especially when a code segment blocks other code. This was the case with our code 
because it was difficult to add a border and change the color of the picture at the same time. For us, teh program would 
run one or the other which became extremely frusturating since we were so close to finishing. It was no till later in which 
a friend showed me how to mesh them together. Looking back on the pain and struggling on this project, it could have been 
easily taken care of.</pre>
