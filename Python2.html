<font size="5"> Python Project #2: Math Help for Students</font>

<pre style="font-family:courier;"> The next project that was assigned was a choice among a group of possible programs
and in the end, my partner, Cecilia, and I decided to create a program that would help students in mathematics ranging 
from Algebra 1 all the way to Calculus. The code was simple when creating it because it followed the same principle as 
the interactive story. Surprising for me was that our code incorporated a double algorithm as when one function was 
called, that function would call another. The example for this is when the calculus function was selected, it would call 
in the other calculus function that contained all the questions for the code.</pre>

<pre style="font-family:courier;">I learned how to improve my coding skills when it comes to incorporating multiple 
algorithms and I learned that using while loops makes the program more efficient and easier on the user if he/she wants 
to keep answering a question until he/she gets it right. It was difficult to work on it due to the several lines of code 
that had to be typed.</pre>
