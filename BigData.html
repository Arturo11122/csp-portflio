<font size="5"> Big Data Presentation </font>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">The topic that is on the minds of many corporations is big data. Big data deals 
with four aspects of data, Velocity, Volume, Value, Variety, and Veracity. For my presentation, I focused on volume 
(the amount of data), velocity (the rate in which data is processed/collected/analyzed), and variety (different 
kinds of data). The project that I did my presentation on was the Human FAmily Tree. A group of scientists want to 
create the largest family tree that connects all humans to one another. The purpose of this project is to discover 
which races are closer to each other, more about the evolution of man, to pinpoint when which genetic trait appeared, 
and to make future predictions on the population.</pre>

<pre style="font-family:courier;">The reason why big data is related to this is because they need as much information 
possible in order to complete the chart (volume). Not only that but the researchers need different types of data such 
as health history, family lineage, income, education level, gender, age, race, ethnicity, etc. (variety). One problem 
that could potentially arise with this feat could be that it will be difficult to analzye and sort all that data, even 
for a computer (velocity). Learning about why big data matters and how it is used to influence people (mass marketing) 
caused me to realize that there is more to computer science than just programming and math, it is a way of life.</pre>
