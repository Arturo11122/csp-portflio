<font size="5"> Simulation Modification</font>
<pre style="font-family:courier;">For this segment, my partner and I both did not save the modified code segment that we worked on.
We worked on an AIDs simulator and what we changed were the color of the infected people, the rate in which AIDs infected people, 
and the rate in which couples would copulate with one another. From us not saving our work to upload to this portfolio is tragic 
but it serves as a learning experience to always save your work and to store it in a palce in which there is easy access. When we 
changed the code, my partner and I looked up where the colors and the rates were stated and we changed the values. People were 
more prone to getting AIDs due to teh changed values.</pre>
