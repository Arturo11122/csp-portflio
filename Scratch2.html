<font size="5"> Scratch Project #2: Dank Meme Quest</font>

<pre style="font-family:courier;">The final project for Scratch was between a story or a game and my partner, David, 
and I decided to create a game and its name is <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/174538457/">Dank Meme Quest<a/>. It was a difficult 
game to create due to the complexity of changing the backgrounds and implementing the enemies.

<pre style="font-family:courier;">The game opening is located on top left. The game was difficult to create (as stated 
from the top) but it was a learning experience as I improved my skills in "writing"
broadcast code. I also improved my skills in adding abstraction code to make the 
unnecessary sprites go away. The code next to the opening of the game displays 
how much code it was needed in order to program one sprite. Although there were multiple 
mistakes made during the coding of teh game, I learned quite a bit about how the blocks of 
code work with one another in order to execute the overall program.</pre>
